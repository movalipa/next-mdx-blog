# Building a Modern Static Blog with Next.js and MDX

`next-mdx-remote`, and `gray-matter` is easier than ever — and incredibly

- How to set up static blog generation

- ✅ Familiar Markdown syntax
- ✅ React components inline
- ✅ Clean content separation from logic

```tsx
<MyComponent prop="value" />
```
